# Communication

**Communication with team members:**
We communicate with each other via WeChat or in-person meeting. Wechat is a channel for instant messaging, on which we can instantly communicate what needs to be done and share resources. In-person meetings are scheduled every Wednesday noon to solve larger problems.

**Communication with the client:**
We communicate with our client with Slack. Client share information and hold online meetings. Our offline meetings are currently scheduled to be held every 2 weeks.Â 

**Communication with tutor/ course convener:**
On Wednesday's tutorial, we have the opportunity to communicate face-to-face with the tutor and course convener. In addition, we use email and Piazza to discuss any possible issues.
