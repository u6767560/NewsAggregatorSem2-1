# Feedback

**Tutor (Course Convener) feedback** 

1. Figure out user scope with the client, decide how we will test our product
2. Ensure that all team members can understand the workflow of the program and rationally allocate members' work

**Action:**

1. We had a meeting with our clients to discuss the goals and plans for the semester, in which we confirmed that our clients wanted to define a clear user scope, which is focusing on Canberra. To achieve this goal, we will improve our crawl range and algorithm weight, and conduct 2-3 user surveys for Canberra users. Basically, the survey will be conducted in the form of a questionnaire scoring system and will run throughout the semester. This will give us an opportunity to improve our website based on user feedback.
2. We divided the team into two groups during team meetings, according to the project objectives, combined with the intention and expertise of the team members. The first group will be responsible for UI and User, and the second group will be responsible for web extraction and algorithms.

**Client feedback**

**Action:**

All materials from last semester including technical resources, codes, audit reports and all other aspects are shared with team members properly.
