# Requirement

## Product Functions

The primary goal of this project is to modify and update the previously implemented machine learning models to improve upon the accuracy of classification and ranking from various news- sources. Furthermore, extend the previous project by implementing a user feedback system to modify/correct our algorithms and possibly show customized content for users based on their choice of interests. This project converges mainly on Canberra based news sources to have a better understanding of user feedback and improve upon location-based importance.

## General Constrains

- The back-end of the program should be based on Python 3.
- The web-based front-end should utilize HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- The program should connect to the company’s database.
- The rank system should be developed based on machine learning or neural networks.
- The input data are pure texts of news.

## Specific Requirements

### Identification Methods

- The model developed should be able to assign a better ranking to the news articles that are not part of the training set.
- The program should be able to recommend new articles to an unregistered user based on the ranking system and location.
- The program  possibly could provide customized content based on a registered user’s interest  

### System Output

- The program shall provide a ranked list of the local news as well as international news.
- The program shall display the recommended news on the front-end.
- The program shall refresh the existent user interface.

### System Input

- The program shall be able to process the textual data from new articles.
- The testing data should use a web crawler to get the testing news from other news webpages
- The model developed should use the existing data set of news as the training set provided by the client.

### Algorithms

Our team should figure out and build another algorithm (like BERT) which is different from the algorithm the client has used (like k-means).

### Optional Function

If time permits, we can integrate a user’s upvotes and downvotes to the algorithm to show suggested news articles.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

### An Operational Website
The program should at least implement 
- The requirement in 3.3.2 System Output to assign better ranks of the inputting news and list them on the front-end. 
- The requirements in 3.3.3 System Input, be able to accept the latest news and use the crawler to form such a test set.

### Appropriate Algorithms in Deep Learning
Our team should improve the current deep learning model which are based on some current open-source algorithm.

### User Survey Report
The user survey’s play an important role in the development of both frontend and backend and how the algorithms functions. For this project, we aim to get feedback from various age groups on how they consume news and their opinion on current age new media, and other aspects which will help us in designing the project and improving the experience of the user on the website.
